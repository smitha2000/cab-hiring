	Problem Solving through Programming in C
By Prof. Anupam Basu   |   IIT Kharagpur
This course is aimed at enabling the students to
Formulate simple algorithms for arithmetic and logical problems
Translate the algorithms to programs (in C language)
Test and execute the programs and  correct syntax and logical errors
Implement conditional branching, iteration and recursion
Decompose a problem into functions and synthesize a complete program using divide and conquer approach
Use arrays, pointers and structures to formulate algorithms and programs
Apply programming to solve matrix addition and multiplication problems and searching and sorting problems 
Apply programming to solve simple numerical method problems, namely rot finding of function, differentiation of function and simple integration

INTENDED AUDIENCE : BE/BTech  in all disciplines BCA/MCA/M. Sc
INDUSTRY SUPPORT : All IT Industries
